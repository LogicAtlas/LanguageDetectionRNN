# LanguageDetectionRNN
This project uses Recurrent Neural Networks constructed from the TensorFlow toolkit to build models for language identification.
### Files
* AlphaBase.py - A class for representing the characters of a set of languages.
* LanguageSource.py - A class that acts as a source of training data.
* LangTestData.py - A class that represents the test data.
* LMSystem.py - A class for training and testing a RNN for the language identification task.
* test_LM.py - A class for running a training and testing session on actual data.
### Instructions for use
* Change the location of the training data. 
* Change the name of the test file. 
* Select the model size.
* Then run: 
python test_LM.py
